        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat using the formula: <br>
        <i>bodymass divided by the square of body height</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3> A person with a BMI of less than 20 is underweight; <br> more than 25 is overweight.  If your BMI is in the range of 20 to 24, 
            then your bodymass is in the acceptable range
        </h3>
        <h4> <i>Disclaimer note: These calculations are for adults. The BMI for children is calculated in the same way but the interpretation is different. </i></h4>
